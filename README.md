# DiffTools Dashboard (MERN + C++ Core)

A high-performance software analysis workspace combining a **C++ Diff Core** with a **MERN Stack Dashboard** for visual code comparison, structural analysis, complexity estimation, and comparison history tracking.

The platform integrates multiple state-of-the-art differencing approaches:

* **Myers Diff** for minimal edit scripts
* **Histogram Diff** for human-readable code reviews
* **GumTree AST Diff** for structural code analysis
* **Complexity Estimation Engine** for asymptotic runtime comparison

---

## Key Features

### 1. Myers Diff Algorithm

Line-based greedy path-finding on the edit graph.

* Minimal edit script generation
* O(ND) complexity
* Excellent for precise text differencing

### 2. Histogram Diff Algorithm

Git-style patience-extension diffing.

* Anchors on unique and rare lines
* Produces highly readable diffs
* Better visual grouping of edits

### 3. GumTree AST Diff Algorithm

Structural differencing using Abstract Syntax Trees.

Supports:

* Insertions
* Deletions
* Updates
* Node Moves

Parses:

* Simple C-like source code
* Lisp-style S-expressions

Uses top-down and bottom-up tree matching to identify structural changes.

### 4. Interactive Visualization Dashboard

* Split View
* Unified View
* Side-by-side comparison
* Color-coded change highlighting
* AST tree visualization
* Diff statistics summary

### 5. Complexity Estimation & Comparison

Heuristic-based static analysis engine capable of estimating:

| Complexity |
| ---------- |
| O(1)       |
| O(log n)   |
| O(√n)      |
| O(n)       |
| O(n log n) |
| O(n²)      |
| O(n³)      |
| O(2^n)     |

Detected patterns include:

* Single loops
* Nested loops
* Logarithmic loops (`i *= 2`, `n /= 2`)
* Square-root traversals
* Sorting algorithms
* Binary Search
* Recursive algorithms
* Graph Traversals (BFS / DFS)
* Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
* Segment Trees

The dashboard displays:

* Estimated complexity
* Confidence score
* Detection reasoning
* Side-by-side complexity comparison
* Complexity verdicts

### 6. Comparison History

* MongoDB persistence
* Reload previous comparisons
* Delete stored comparisons
* Automatic in-memory fallback when MongoDB is unavailable

## Setup & Running Instructions

### 1. Compile the C++ Diff Engine

```bash
g++ -O3 -std=c++14 backend/src/main.cpp backend/src/myers.cpp backend/src/histogram.cpp backend/src/ast.cpp backend/src/gumtree.cpp -o backend/diff_engine.exe
```

---

### 2. Start MongoDB

Ensure MongoDB is running locally:

```bash
mongod
```

Default connection:

```text
mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/diffproject
```

If MongoDB is unavailable, the application automatically switches to in-memory history storage.

---

### 3. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Backend URL:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

---

### 4. Start Frontend Dashboard

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## Example Use Cases

### Code Review

Compare two source files using:

* Myers Diff
* Histogram Diff

to identify textual modifications.

### Refactoring Analysis

Use GumTree AST Diff to detect:

* Function moves
* Structural updates
* Node insertions/deletions

### Algorithm Optimization

Compare two implementations and estimate:

```text
O(n²) → O(n log n)
```

or

```text
O(n) → O(log n)
```

using the Complexity Comparison dashboard.
